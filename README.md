# TutTut
Tut-Tut, the IoT Raindrop Detector, is a project under the domain of the OPEnS (Openly Published Environment Sensing) Lab at Oregon State University. 
Tut-Tut will be able to detect a raindrop of any size, get an idea of the drop's mass from the intensity at which it falls, and detect the frequency of raindrops. 
After Tut-Tut gathers this data, it will be able to wirelessly transmit the information to a central server and communicate it to other IoT devices around Oregon State University.
The detector will wake up with a single raindrop and will stay awake as long as rain is detected within a minute. If it does not detect raindrops within a minute, it will go back to sleep.
In addition to the physical device, we will also design an online mobile application to which the physical device will transmit information about the raindrops.
